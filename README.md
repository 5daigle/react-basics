# react-basics

Objectives:
* Gather all the commonly used components (buttons, selects, etc) in a single library.
* Use the Emotion library for the styling.
* Code the component in an optimal structure using typescript, testing with jest and storybook.
* Create components with intuitive props to easily fit the project's needs
* Create components with enought props to enable their customization

Styling:
By default, this library only use emotion for styling. However, you can enable normal css by
uncommenting the postcss package (and it's import statement) in rollup.config.js.

Upgrade the package version:
1. Change the package version to a higher number in the package.json
2. Run `npm run rollup` and `npm publish` from the computer where you have the `~/.npmrc` file

Use latest version
To use the new version, in your project where you import this library, use: 
1. `npm view @5daigle/react-basics version` or pluralise `version(s)` to get a list of all versions available.
2. `npm install @5daigle/react-basics@VERSION_NUMBER`

Peer dependencies
* DO NOT ADD REACT into the peer deps, or storybook won't work.
* Typescript is not needed as a peer dep.
